### JAWS - A famouse movie AND a useful baseball statistic!
[JAWS](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/jaws.shtml) is an analytical baseball stat designed to help sort and compare players when looking at their entire careers. It's especially useufl in regards to how players compare to others already in the Hall of Fame.
Along with many advanced baseball analysis, JAWS uses [WAR](https://library.fangraphs.com/misc/war/) - Wins Above Replacement.
> If you're not already familiar with WAR, it attempts to encapsulate everything a player does into one number. It compares a player's performance against a hypothetical "replacement" player - like a player likely to be called up from AAA when a regular is injured. For a single 162 game season, ~2 WAR is considered an average starter, ~4-5 an All-Star, and 6+ for MVP/Cy Young contenders.
